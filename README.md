# Appreciation
I would like to use this platform to thank Sir Ebenezer Ogoe for always being there to assist me when I had difficulties in solving a particular problem and also being there to help me solve errors which I found hard to solve by myself.
I also appreciate his ideas and suggestion to help me write a better and more efficient code. Lastly, I thank all my group members to being cooperative and supportive in this project.
